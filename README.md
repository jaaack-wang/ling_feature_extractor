# ling_feature_extractor
A python program I built for my thesis project to extract 98 linguistic features. Over 2/3 of them come from Biber et al.(2006) with 42 features also present in Biber (1988). These features are generally known as part of the Multi-Dimensional analysis framework.

A final package is still yet to be finished.
